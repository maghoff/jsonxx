JSONxx
======

This is a C++ library I wrote to help me generate JSON. It can also parse JSON,
but it wasn't really designed with parsing in mind, so that is probably not
what you want to use this library for yet. I hope to address that in a future
version.

The library is licensed under [the MIT license][MIT].

Please read more in the [documentation][doc].
